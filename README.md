# 🎰 Game Engine 🚀

A simple game engine is written in C#. It is created in the .Net Full Framework version since it needs Windows Forms and Windows Api for this game.
This is my first try creating a simple game engine and it turned out pretty good in my opinion. 🚗😀

The game goal is to collect all the coins in the shortest time possible. Each new game recreates the coins and player in different locations. When all coins are collected, time stops. ⏰
